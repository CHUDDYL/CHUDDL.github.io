    <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I am <strong>Lewis Lorimer</strong>, a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Dundee with a strong interest in software development.
      I enjoy using my ability to code to create solutions to any task i have been set, I can code in multiple languages: C, Java, Python, HTML and CSS. I also have real life experience 
      working in a development enviroment where I created a website for a client. I have shown my ability to work as a team with a part time job where I proved to be a reliable employee 
      and applied my skills brilliantly to ensure I would succeed. My goal is to begin a career as a junior software developer, contributing to projects that make an impact while continuously
      developing my technical skills in coding, and my transferable ones in the industry. So, with that said, welcome to my online portfolio. I hope it can impress and show my dedication to 
      my goals, and my desire to work in a computing enviroment.
